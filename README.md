This is the HTML/CSS/JS behind the YouTube video "[YUI 3's Use and Add Methods](http://youtu.be/1iDt5mpaNXM)". It's takes full advantage of CSS3 transforms, so be sure to view it in a browser with transform support (e.g. Chrome).

Technologies used to build slides:
- [Impress.js](http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/) (I've added a couple customizations to my copy to enable actions within slides)
- [YUI3](http://yuilibrary.com)
- [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com) (Yes, a YUI presentation uses jQuery. I needed a it for the next item)
- [ArcText](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/01/24/arctext-js-curving-text-with-css3-and-jquery/) (Used to bend text around YUI logo)
